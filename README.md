Issuing badges to credit authors for their work on academic papers

As the research environment becomes more digital, we want to test how we can use this medium to help bring transparency and credit for individuals in the publication process.

## Using Paper Badger

You can display contributorship badges for science on your own site! Researchers earn badges for their specific contributions to an academic paper. A researcher who worked on investigation earns a prestigious investigation badge for that paper.

The PaperBadger widget enables *anyone*, from publishers to individual researchers, to easily display badges on a website by including just a few lines of script with the relevant doi (digital object identifier) and a designated `<div>` in your view file. Authors can add the script to their own sites to display badges earned, while publishers can use the script to display all badges associated with a paper:

You can either use paper-badger-widget.js ([documentation](docs/paper-badger-widget.md)), which supports old browsers or widget.js ([documentation](docs/widget.md)), which is in development and currently only supports evergreen browsers and IE9+.

### Current Users

Two journals, [GigaScience (BioMed Central)](http://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/) and [Journal of Open Research Software (Ubiquity Press)](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/) have added the Paper Badger widget to their papers.

## Contributing

[Project Roadmap: #17](https://github.com/mozillascience/paperbadger/issues/17)

Want to help? We love new contributors! Please review our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and take a look at some [good first bugs](https://github.com/mozillascience/PaperBadger/labels/good%20first%20bug).

### Getting Started

Are you ready to contribute to Paper Badger? This section will help you set up your own development version of the Contributorship Badges prototype.

Clone (or Fork) PaperBadger and enter the directory: `git clone https://github.com/mozillascience/PaperBadger && cd PaperBadger`

For an overview of the [architecture](docs/high-level-architecture.md) of the system and other details, visit the [docs](docs/) section.

#### Badges Server
PaperBadger relies on [Badgr Server](https://github.com/concentricsky/badgr-server) to manage all actions related to
badges. You can install Badgr directly from github, or you can use this docker
[local-badgr-server](https://github.com/josmas/local-badgr-server) setup,
especially built for this project, to speed things up a little.

#### Environment variables
If you would like to override the default configuration, create an `.env` file in your favourite text editor and use _default.env_ as a template (do not delete or modify _default.env_).

If you would like to develop against the hosted custom badgekit-api we have running specifically for PaperBadger testing, your environment values should look this:

        # default port is 5000
        export PORT=5000
        export SESSION_SECRET=USE_SOMETHING_GOOD_LIKE_puUJjfE6QtUnYryb

        # Badgr Server
        export BADGR_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/
        export BADGR_USER=#############
        export BADGR_PASSWORD=#############

        # ORCID Auth
        export ORCID_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=#############
        export ORCID_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=#############
        export ORCID_AUTH_SITE=#############
        export ORCID_AUTH_TOKEN_PATH=#############
        export ORCID_REDIRECT_URI=#############

Feel free to change `PORT` to any available port.
Note that you will have to provide your own [Badgr](https://github.com/concentricsky/badgr-server) server, and register
for a development account with [ORCID](http://orcid.org/).

#### Run using Docker

You can use Docker to bring up a quick instance of the app to develop against. This way you don't need to have node, MongoDB, and redis installed on your host.

* Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (>=1.10) and docker-compose (>=1.6) installed.
* Setup your environment variables as explained in the previous section
* start the service with `docker-compose up`
* visit the running service
  * If on Linux host: http://localhost:5000
  * If not Linux: http://(docker_host_ip):5000 (You can find your docker IP with `docker-machine ip default`)

This setup will create 3 containers:
  - paperbadger_paperbadger_1 contains the PaperBadger code, mapped to the _/src_ volume
  - paperbadger_mongo_1 is the MongoDB container with a DB called _test_
  - paperbadger_redis_1 is the redis server

You can connect to the main container by using `docker exec -it paperbadger_paperbadger_1 /bin/bash`. _ctrl+c_ will stop the three containers.

#### Run locally

* Make sure you have at least node version 4.4.5 installed. Installing node through [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended, so you don't need to use _sudo_ in the next step.
* Install PaperBadger's Node dependencies: `npm install`
* Make sure [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and [redis-server](http://redis.io/download) are running and locally accessible. You can install these from their official website or use your favorite package manager.
* Setup your environment variables as explained in a previous section
* Run `npm start`, and open up `http://localhost:5000/` in your favourite web browser!
