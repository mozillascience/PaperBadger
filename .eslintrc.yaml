# This is a modified set of rules based on the baseline defined in mofo-style v 2.3.0.
# This project was started with a much older version of mofo-style, using jshint, and this is an
# effort to tranistion the project to use the latest version, which is intended for usage in any ES6-based project.

# The main changes in the file are as follows:
#  Eliminated rules:
#   - valid-jsdoc
#   - newline-after-var
#   - no-lonely-if
#   - prefer-arrow-callback
#  Modified rules:
#   - arrowFunctions: false // instead of true
#   - quotes: [2, "single"] // instead of "backtick"
#   - no-use-before-define: [2, "nofunc"] // instead of defaulting to none
#
# The specific environment(s) needed are configured in this file directly.
